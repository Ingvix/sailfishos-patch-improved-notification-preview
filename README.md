# sailfishos-patch-improved-notification-preview
Moves a bit enlarged icon inside the notification bubble and provides settings to customize notification preview's look and behavior.

You can determine

* Style of the preview
* Margin and corner radius (if selected style permits)
* Maximum and minimum width
* Duration which the preview is shown
* What tapping  the preview and swiping it left, right and/or down does.

No more waiting for notifications to time-out out of the way or gathering useless notifications to the events view.

Currently, removing does not work with email notifications. It has probably something to do with notification's email address headers as normally the header is the app's name.

Requires Patchmanager.
